Types of Materialization
    -Table: Model is rebuilt as a table on each run
        - Fast to query but slow to build and not updated automatically
    -View: Model is rebuilt as a view on each run
        - Quick to build and automatically updates but slow to query
    -Incremental: Only new or updated records added to table on each run
        - Quick build time but can have advanced configuration
        - Good for data that is stored in event-like fashion
    -Ephemeral: Temporary tables are created but not added into the database
        - Reuseable logic for multiple models
