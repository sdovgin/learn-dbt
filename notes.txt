Types of Materialization
    -Table: Model is rebuilt as a table on each run
        - Fast to query but slow to build and not updated automatically
    -View: Model is rebuilt as a view on each run
        - Quick to build and automatically updates but slow to query
    -Incremental: Only new or updated records added to table on each run
        - Quick build time but can have advanced configuration
        - Good for data that is stored in event-like fashion
    -Ephemeral: Temporary tables are created but not added into the database
        - Reuseable logic for multiple models

Changing the materialization of a model can be done by adding this to the top of the model 
{{ config(materialized='{type_of_materialization}', unique_key='{key_value}') }}

or by setting the default materalization in the dbt_project.yml file

models:
  learn_dbt:
    # Config indicated by + and applies to all files under models/example/
    example:
      +materialized: {type_of_materialization}
